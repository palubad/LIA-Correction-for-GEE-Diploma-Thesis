# LIA Correction for Google Earth Engine 
## (part of my Diploma Thesis)

This code repository is an attachment for my Diploma Thesis "A correction of the local incidence angle of SAR data: a land-cover specific approach for time series analysis".
The repository contains a folder "javascript_codes" where you can find: 
  - A GEE function "LIA_Correction_Example.js" to create a SAR image collection where bands have been corrected for effects of terrain
  - A GEE example usage of the function
  - Folder containing codes of (mainly) statistical analysis which were used for evaluating the effectivity and the accuracy of the proposed method
